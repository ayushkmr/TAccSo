## üåü About TAccSo

### Vision
Our vision is to revolutionize the way professionals interact with all tax and accounting-related communications and correspondence, eliminating inefficiencies and manual processes. By starting with tax practitioners and accountants, we aim to create a seamless, automated solution that simplifies complex workflows, ensuring timely communication and task management. Our broader goal is to expand this transformation to all professional services, enabling professionals to focus on delivering value to their clients while increasing efficiency and reducing errors.

### Mission
Our mission is to rapidly develop and refine solutions that automate the handling of all tax and accounting-related communications, starting with documents. By closely collaborating with tax practitioners and accountants, we will quickly adapt and pivot based on their needs, ensuring our product evolves to simplify workflows and enhance communication. As we experiment and learn, we remain focused on delivering real value to our users, with the long-term goal of expanding our solution to all professional services.

### Company Values

#### Customer Obsession
We are not competitor-obsessed, we are customer-obsessed. Our mission starts and ends with our customers. We earn their trust every day by listening closely, anticipating their needs, and delivering solutions that make their lives easier. As we move fast, test, and pivot, everything we do is to create seamless, efficient experiences for tax practitioners, accountants, and all professional services.

#### Take Ownership
Leaders at our company act like owners. They take responsibility for the success of our product and the satisfaction of our customers. If there‚Äôs a problem, we don‚Äôt pass the buck- we fix it. We never say, ‚ÄòThat‚Äôs not my job,‚Äô because the success of our vision depends on everyone taking initiative and solving problems.

#### Invent and Simplify
At our core, we are builders. We strive to invent and simplify complex processes that burden professionals in tax, accounting, and beyond. By breaking down the problems our customers face, we create simple, elegant solutions that reduce complexity, improve efficiency, and help our users focus on what matters most.

#### Bias for Action
Speed matters in business. We believe in taking bold steps quickly, iterating fast, and adjusting as we go. We don‚Äôt wait for perfect conditions to act. Our approach is rooted in rapid experimentation‚Äîgetting out there, learning from our customers, and pivoting when necessary, all while keeping our vision in sight.

#### Learn and Be Curious
We are never done learning and always seek to improve. Whether it's by diving into customer feedback or experimenting with new ideas, curiosity drives us forward. Our curiosity fuels our innovation, leading us to develop solutions that reshape entire industries, starting with tax and accounting professionals.

#### Deliver Results
We are results-driven. It‚Äôs not about how hard we work‚Äîit‚Äôs about what we deliver. Our customers depend on us to help them simplify their workflows and stay ahead of their challenges. We measure ourselves not by effort, but by the impact we create for our users, ensuring we build trust and deliver tangible results.

#### Frugality
We do more with less. Constraints breed resourcefulness, self-sufficiency, and invention. We don‚Äôt throw money at problems; we solve them with ingenuity. This lean approach drives us to be efficient and focus on providing maximum value to our customers at the lowest cost.

#### High Standards
Leaders at our company maintain relentlessly high standards. We challenge ourselves and our teams to raise the bar, continually pushing the boundaries of what‚Äôs possible. Our vision demands nothing less than excellence, and we never settle for good enough‚Äîespecially when it comes to the customer experience.

#### Think Big
Thinking small is a self-fulfilling prophecy. Our vision is to revolutionize entire industries, and that requires thinking big. We push ourselves to dream bigger, imagine bolder futures, and challenge conventional thinking. Starting with tax and accounting professionals, we aim to change how entire professional services operate.

#### Earn Trust
We earn the trust of our customers, partners, and teams by delivering on our promises and holding ourselves accountable. We communicate openly and act with integrity. Trust is the foundation upon which we build lasting relationships, and we work tirelessly to protect it.

### Find the ‚ÄúWhy‚Äù in Your Work

1. **Why are you doing this?** It is easy to focus on tasks without questioning their purpose. Reflect on why you are working on a specific task. Who benefits from it, and what is the motivation behind it? Understanding the purpose can lead to better engagement and alignment with the team's goals.

2. **What problem are you solving?** Clarify the issue you are addressing. Are customers confused? Is there a gap that needs to be filled? Sometimes, the problem may not be real or significant, which signals that it is time to reevaluate the task. Focus on solving real, impactful problems.

3. **Is this actually useful?** Differentiate between enthusiasm and usefulness. While creating something exciting can be fun, ultimately, the outcome should be valuable. Ask yourself if the work you are doing will have lasting utility or if it is just ‚Äúcool‚Äù in the short term.

4. **Are you adding value?** Reflect on whether your contribution enhances the product or service. Adding something is easy, but ensuring it provides real value to the customer is more challenging. Does this work improve the customer experience or just complicate things unnecessarily?

5. **Will this change behavior?** Consider whether the task you are working on will have a real impact. Will it alter how people use or engage with the product? If the change does not significantly affect behavior, you might need to reassess its importance.

6. **Is there an easier way?** Simplicity often leads to better results. Ask yourself whether there is a simpler or more efficient approach to what you are doing. Often, complex problems have simple solutions that are "good enough" for the moment.

7. **What could you be doing instead?** Reflect on opportunity cost. What are you unable to focus on because of this task? In teams with limited resources, it is crucial to prioritize tasks that provide the most impact. Could your time be better spent on something else?
